# Steam Auto Queue

This script will automatically click next on all the games in your queue so you can clear it out and get your card.


## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) if you're using Firefox, or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) if you're using Chome. Steam Auto Queue will not work without Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.
2. After Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey are installed, visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiveElementNinja/Steam-Auto-Queue/master/steam-auto-queue.user.js and it will prompt you to install the script.

## Usage
1. Once Steam Auto Queue is installed, visit http://store.steampowered.com/explore/ and click where it says "*Click here to begin exploring your queue*" to start the process.
2. Steam Auto Queue will automatically click Next on each page load until your queue is empty.
3. Repeat up to 3 times a day to get all your cards.

## Notes

* It is highly recommended you disable the script each day after you've received your 3 cards for that day so it doesn't kick in when you're trying to view a store page for a game.
* If you run into any issues or errors, shoot me a message me on Twitter: [@FivElementNinja](https://twitter.com/FivElementNinja)
* **This script is auto-updating. You should only install auto-updating scripts from sources you trust. If you are not comfortable with that, don't install this script.**
